## Intro
At Feb 03 2023, a chapter of life is closed, I can't say it's an easy change, but I see it as a chance to take a turn in my way of working, I was inspired to become more proactive as a software developer.
I had many ideas for my own projects, but due to many reasons, I can not send any of them into life before, now with the time and the right knowledge, I'd like to give them a chance to be exposed.
Below is a list of my ideas, let's see any of them will become available by the end of the year!

## Ideas/Plans
- Become external contributor for open source projects
- Create a user script ( Tampermonkey, maybe ) to make a trick to github issues, making it support the threaded comments like discussions
- Pick an open source react component to contribute storybook updates for them and learning on the way: eg: react-guitar-chord
- Seeking possibility for isolated gutenberg editor to be integrated into github markdown editor
