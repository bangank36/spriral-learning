My learning resource

### Table of content
## Agenda
- TODO: Should create a folder for this?
- It contains my ideas, plans that popped out from my mind, there should be a main file by the start of the year and regular check-in every 3 or 6 months
## Opensource contribution
- The whole contribution process will be tracked on [this project](https://github.com/users/bangank36/projects/1/views/1)
- This is personal project, so it should be good to not create references on the origin repo, in order to cross-linking without creating references, I linked the external issues and PRs with the domain togithub.com. Credit thanks to [this discussion](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/23123#discussioncomment-3239236)

## Today I learned
- TODO: create a .md file to put all the quick links or gist about the researchs
